# Knowledge Engineering of PhD Stories

Research project (brief) description: This research project deals with the qualitative analysis of PhD stories and their knowledge-based interpretation and representation using Semantic Web technologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs in a bottom-up approach. Individual PhD stories are collected and analyzed via qualitative methods in order to create a common knowledge model for these stories in the form of ontologies and interpreted in a knowledge graph. The main goal of this project is to model the knowledge contained in the stories and create a knowledge-based repository of PhD stories and an application and search interface on top of it.
